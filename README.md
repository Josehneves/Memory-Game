## Descripiton
Step into the halls of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the challenge awaits. Harry Potter and The Memory Game is a game that transports you through the seven Harry Potter movies, featuring a distinct pair of images from each cinematic masterpiece. With 14 pairs in total, get ready to explore the magical journey from "The Sorcerer's Stone" to "The Deathly Hallows."

As the game begins, you'll have a mere 70 seconds to gaze upon the captivating images and commit them to memory. The challenge lies in matching the pairs correctly, beware of the perilous consequences of a wrong guess. Lose a life with each misstep, and with seven lives at your disposal, the threat of expulsion looms. Can you maintain your composure and persevere, or will you succumb to the pressure of the magical challenge?

But fear not, young wizard! For every successful match, you earn points, inching closer to the coveted House Cup. If you can successfully pair all 14 sets of images, you will emerge victorious, securing glory for your house and earning the admiration of your fellow witches and wizards.

Get ready to showcase your magical prowess and embark on a mesmerizing journey through the wizarding world. Harry Potter and The Memory Game awaits, where the magic of memory meets the thrill of the wizarding world!

## Future Enhancements

As a future plan I pretend to make the game more resposive in different screen sizes and also use React to bring it to mobile application instead of it being on the browser, I belive this will allow a better user experiece.
